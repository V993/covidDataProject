            Contact tracing is a study carried out to study patterns and locations of events in order to
            track down the source. With the current Covid-19 situation, it appears as though there will be a mass
            increase in positive cases and deaths. Social distancing has worked quite well for sometime, however,
            do we always know where it is safe and where it isn't?
            The sad reality is that we don't, not unless we carry out this project.
            Below can be see statistics of the current situation
