Covid Data Project is an intuitive, easy-to-use web application dedicated 
to providing relevant information on the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The goal of the app is to provide a digestible breakdown of COVID-19 numbers
for the average person, while simultaneously enabling users to contact-trace
directly from the app. Users can check covid numbers and spread with data from
[The Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/api)'s database 
and extensive API.

The project is built in React, using MaterialUI for styling.
